Assignment 01 for Fall 2025 Applied Math Class

This assignment serves as an introduction to root-finding algorithms. A root, or zero, of a function f(x), is an input
x0 that satisfies the condition f(x_0) = 0. As such, a root-finding algorithm is an algorithm (i.e. a sequence of
mathematical instructions) for computing the roots of a function. In this module, we will be taking a look at three
different numerical methods for root-finding: the bisection method, Newton’s method, and the secant method.

The bulk of this assignment will involve implementing and testing these three root-finding methods in order to
better understand how each works. When it comes to numerical methods, there is usually no free lunch: there is no
perfect algorithm for a given type of problem. Each algorithm comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses.
During and after implementation and testing, you will be asked to think about when it would be preferable to use
one of these algorithms instead of another.

Finally, at the end of the assignment, you will be challenged to use a combination of these methods to solve a
difficult numerical problem in order to give you some practice thinking about how to apply these new tools to solve
a problem that you haven’t seen before. One of the deliverables for this part will be an animation of the system being
modeled. This assignment will walk you through the necessary steps of generating the animation in MATLAB and
then converting it to a video, which is something that you will do several times throughout this course.
